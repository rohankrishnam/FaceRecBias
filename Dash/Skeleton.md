# Dash Graph Analysis Skeleton

This skeleton serves to outline the process of using Dash to analyze the curves and tables representing data found from the facerec-bias-bfw

What is Dash?
A Python framework for building web apps, especially regarding data visualization apps in pure Python
	Will be useful for explaining the fairly complex graphs and charts we have to present

Part 1
First we will need to install Dash through Pycharm, then decide on a template to utilize for consistency with our documentation
List of possible templates:

Part 2
We can look at our curves and tables in the “Results” folder, and figure out the most efficient way to make it user-friendly 
regarding the public’s understanding of our data SDM(signal detection models) curve, NN error analysis, DET(detection error trade-off)
curves. TAR at FAR, human evaluation(quantitative), DET curves for different CNN models, boxplot, violin plot

Part 3
Present graphs with brief background information to a small non-data science group to gauge their thoughts
	Whether or not the documentation is understandable
